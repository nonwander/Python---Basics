# Lesson 1 - Python Basics

> **Note:** My goal in completing these tasks was not to demonstrate my knowledge of the basics of Python, but to use tasks to improve the practice of writing structured applications that satisfy some minimum requirements for code readability and lack of redundancy relative to the source task.

1. Work with variables, create several, display them on the screen. Ask the user for some numbers and strings and save them to variables, then display them on the screen.

2. The user enters the time in seconds. Convert the time to hours, minutes, seconds and output in format like ```hh:mm:cc```. Use string formatting.

3. Find out from the user the number ```n```. Find the sum of the numbers ```n + nn + nnn```.
<br>_Example:_
<br>User entered: ```3```
<br>We count: ```3 + 33 + 333 = 369```

4. The user enters a positive integer. Find the largest digit in the number. Use the ```while``` loop and arithmetic operations to solve this.

5. Ask the user for the values of the company revenue and costs, then determine company financial result.
<br>_Example:_
<br>```profit``` — ```revenue``` is greater than ```costs```
<br>loss — ```costs``` are greater than ```revenue```.
<br>Print the corresponding message.

6. If the company has worked with ```profit```, then calculate the profitability of ```revenue```. This is the ratio of ```profit``` to ```revenue```. Request the number of ```employees``` of the company and determine the company's ```profit per employee```.

7. _(Optional)_ The athlete is engaged in daily jogging. On the first day his result was ```a``` km. Every day the athlete increased the result by ```10%``` relative to the previous result. Determine the number of the day on which the athlete's result will be at least ```b``` km. The program should take the values of parameters ```a``` and ```b``` and output only one natural number — it is the number of the day.

_Example:_
```
a = 2, b = 3.
Result:
1st day:
2nd day: 2.2
3rd day: 2.42
Day 4: 2.66
Day 5: 2.93
Day 6: 3.22
Answer: on the sixth day the athlete achieved a result of at least 3 km.
```
