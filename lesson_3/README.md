# Lesson 1 - Python Basics
## Functions in Python

```
My goal in completing these tasks was not to demonstrate my knowledge of the basics of Python, but to use tasks to improve the practice of writing structured applications that satisfy some minimum requirements for code readability and lack of redundancy relative to the source task.
```

1. Implement a function that requests from the user two numbers (positional arguments) and returns their division. Ensure that the division by zero exception is handled.

2. Perform a function that requests several parameters describing the user's data: first name, last name, year of birth, city of residence, email, phone. The function must accept parameters as named arguments. Implement output user data in one line.

3. Implement the ```my_func()``` function, which takes three positional arguments and returns the sum of the largest two of them.

4. The program requests a real positive number ```x``` and a negative integer ```y```. Perform the exponentiation of the number ```x``` to the power of ```y```. Implement the task as a function ```my_func(x, y)```. Solve a task **without** the built-in exponentiation function.
_Hint:_ two ways to solving:
1) exponentiation using the ```**``` operator;
2) involving the use of a loop.

5. The program asks the User for a string of numbers separated by a space. When you press Enter, the sum of the numbers should be displayed. The User can continue entering numbers separated by a space and press Enter again. The sum of the newly entered numbers will be added to the already calculated amount.
But if a special character is entered instead of a number, the program execution ends. If a special character is entered after several numbers, then first you need to add the sum of these numbers to the amount received earlier and then terminate the program.

6. Implement the ```int_func()``` function which requests words from small Latin letters and returns them the same, but with the uppercase first letter.
_Example:_ ```print(int_func(â€˜text')) -> Text```

7. Continue working on the task. The program should requests a string of words separated by a space. Each word consists of lowercase Latin letters. You need to output the original string, but each word must begin with a capital letter. Use the previously written int_func() function.
